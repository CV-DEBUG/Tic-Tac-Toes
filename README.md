## Tic-Tac-Toes

This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. The project is designed for learning and experimenting with basic game development concepts in Python.

### Features
- Basic Tic-Tac-Toe gameplay
- Simple and easy-to-understand code
- Suitable for beginners

### Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository and run the main Python script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CV-DEBUG/Tic-Tac-Toes.git
cd Tic_Tac_Toes
python3 Algo_Morpion.py for launch a round with the Terminator
or
python3 Human_Morpion.py if you want to launch a round with an other Human
```
### Documentation
The project was developed using the book "Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python" by Al Sweigart, published by No Starch Press. This book provides a hands-on introduction to programming in Python, including a chapter on creating classic games like Tic-Tac-Toe.
